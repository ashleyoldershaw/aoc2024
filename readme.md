# Advent of Code 2024!

![Unit test badge](https://github.com/ashleyoldershaw/aoc2024/actions/workflows/run_tests.yaml/badge.svg)

## Intro

A learning opportunity for me. I do a lot of coding but I don't do much that is demanding in the same way. Web app development is a different skillset entirely. I enjoy this stuff!


## Architecture

I'm using Python FastAPI - no real reason other than I've never used it before and it seems interesting. It's quite easy to test, and modularise.

## Aims

Brush up on a bunch of the algorithms and data structures I've learned before and learn some new stuff. I don't expect to get all the stars but I do expect to get some!
